Mostly made this mod because I can't wait for [this bug](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/219323-sas-does-not-hold-orientation-during-time-warp/);  
But also this mod fixes (or, more like, hides) [this bug](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/221762-accelerate-under-timewarp-still-not-working-in-some-cases-post-v020/?do=findComment&comment=4368920).
