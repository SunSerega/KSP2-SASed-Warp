KSP2 mod for junky ah SAS locking during warp

Demonstration: https://youtu.be/-9DohaLUHOc

Mostly made this because I can't wait for [this](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/219323-sas-does-not-hold-orientation-during-time-warp/)  
But also I expect even trash like this will last me at least long enough for devs to fix it properly.
